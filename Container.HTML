        <h1>Sense Organs</h1>
        <p>Sense organs are specialized body parts that allow humans and other animals to sense the world around them:
        Eyes: Provide the sense of sight
        Ears: Provide the sense of hearing
        Nose: Provides the sense of smell
        Tongue: Provides the sense of taste
        Skin: Provides the sense of touch
        Sense organs contain receptors that relay information to the nervous system. When external stimuli are detected, the
        sensory organs send signals to the brain through sensory nerves. The brain interprets the signals and responds, helping
        the sense organs to reciprocate. This process helps humans connect to their environment.</p>

        <h1>Emotions</h1>
        <p>Emotions are conscious mental reactions that are experienced as strong feelings. They are a complex reaction pattern
        that involves:
        Subjective experience: How the emotion is experienced
        Physiological response: How the body responds to the emotion
        Behavioral response: How the emotion is expressed
        Emotions are a way for people to deal with situations or matters that they find personally significant. The specific
        quality of the emotion is determined by the significance of the event. For example, if the event involves a threat, fear
        is likely to be generated.</p>
