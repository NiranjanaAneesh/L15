        <h1>Sense Organs</h1>
        <p>Sense organs are specialized body parts that allow humans and other animals to sense the world around them:
        Eyes: Provide the sense of sight
        Ears: Provide the sense of hearing
        Nose: Provides the sense of smell
        Tongue: Provides the sense of taste
        Skin: Provides the sense of touch
        Sense organs contain receptors that relay information to the nervous system. When external stimuli are detected, the
        sensory organs send signals to the brain through sensory nerves. The brain interprets the signals and responds, helping
        the sense organs to reciprocate. This process helps humans connect to their environment.</p>
