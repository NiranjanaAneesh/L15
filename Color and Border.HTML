        <h1>Margin Padding Border</h1>
        <p>In CSS and HTML, margin, border, and padding are used to control the spacing around an element:
            Margin
            The space outside of an element, or the space between an element and the edge of the page or screen. Margins can
            create
            whitespace between elements.
            Border
            The perimeter of an element, which can be a thick colored line or invisible.
            Padding
            The space inside of an element, or the space between the element's content and its border. Padding can control how
            much
            of the background color is visible around the content.
            Here are some tips for using margin, border, and padding:
            You can use one to four values to define your margins. The first value is the top margin, and the next values follow
            in
            a clockwise direction.
            You can use HTML to implement basic settings, but it's best to use both HTML and CSS for total customization.
            Before CSS became more common, tables were used to introduce margins and padding for specific elements.</p>
